# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** project repository. This repository is part of the *FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint* project, which focuses on developing a detailed and structured approach to requirement analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## üìå Purpose

This project simulates a real-world scenario where you will define the requirements for a **Booking Management System**. It emphasizes clarity, precision, and structure in documenting both functional and non-functional requirements to lay the groundwork for a successful development process.

## üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs Included

- Introduction to requirement analysis concepts
- Requirement gathering documentation
- Functional vs. non-functional requirements
- Use case identification and diagramming
- Visual modeling using Draw.io
- Acceptance criteria for features

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand and apply SDLC principles
- Translate business needs into clear, testable requirements
- Use diagrams to visualize system actors and interactions
- Define acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Apply best practices in documentation and modeling

## üß∞ Tools Used

- GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Markdown for documentation
- Draw.io (or equivalent) for diagramming use cases

## üìñ What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation upon which all other development phases are built.

This process ensures that developers and project stakeholders have a clear, mutual understanding of what the system is supposed to do, how it should behave, and any constraints or conditions that must be considered.

### üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting requirements from stakeholders such as users, clients, and subject matter experts through interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and observations.
- **Requirement Classification**: Categorizing requirements into functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (how the system performs its tasks).
- **Requirement Prioritization**: Determining which requirements are most critical for delivering business value.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring all documented requirements are accurate, complete, consistent, and feasible.
- **Documentation**: Presenting the requirements in clear, structured formats like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), use case diagrams, and user stories.

### üéØ Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:
- **Reduces Development Risks**: Clear requirements reduce the chances of project failures due to misunderstandings or incomplete information.
- **Improves Communication**: Aligns expectations between stakeholders, designers, and developers.
- **Enhances Planning and Estimation**: Accurate requirements allow better project planning, budgeting, and resource allocation.
- **Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction**: Ensures the final product meets user needs and business goals.
- **Supports Testing**: Well-defined requirements serve as a basis for test case design and acceptance testing.

Requirement Analysis is not a one-time activity‚Äîit evolves as projects progress, ensuring systems remain aligned with changing user needs and business objectives.
