## üìñ What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation upon which all other development phases are built.

This process ensures that developers and project stakeholders have a clear, mutual understanding of what the system is supposed to do, how it should behave, and any constraints or conditions that must be considered.

### üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting requirements from stakeholders such as users, clients, and subject matter experts through interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and observations.
- **Requirement Classification**: Categorizing requirements into functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (how the system performs its tasks).
- **Requirement Prioritization**: Determining which requirements are most critical for delivering business value.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring all documented requirements are accurate, complete, consistent, and feasible.
- **Documentation**: Presenting the requirements in clear, structured formats like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), use case diagrams, and user stories.

### üéØ Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:
- **Reduces Development Risks**: Clear requirements reduce the chances of project failures due to misunderstandings or incomplete information.
- **Improves Communication**: Aligns expectations between stakeholders, designers, and developers.
- **Enhances Planning and Estimation**: Accurate requirements allow better project planning, budgeting, and resource allocation.
- **Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction**: Ensures the final product meets user needs and business goals.
- **Supports Testing**: Well-defined requirements serve as a basis for test case design and acceptance testing.

Requirement Analysis is not a one-time activity‚Äîit evolves as projects progress, ensuring systems remain aligned with changing user needs and business objectives.

## ‚ùó Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a foundational role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the software being built aligns with business goals, user expectations, and technical constraints. Here are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical:

### 1. ‚úÖ Ensures Project Success
By clearly defining what the system should do and how it should behave, Requirement Analysis helps avoid scope creep, miscommunication, and conflicting objectives. It sets a solid direction for development and minimizes the risk of costly rework or project failure.

### 2. üìä Improves Resource Planning and Estimation
Accurate and well-defined requirements allow teams to better estimate time, budget, and resources needed for development. This results in more reliable project plans, timelines, and delivery schedules.

### 3. üß™ Provides a Basis for Testing and Validation
Requirements form the foundation for designing test cases. With clearly documented acceptance criteria, developers and testers can validate that the system performs as expected and meets user needs, ensuring higher quality and satisfaction.

Other benefits include enhanced stakeholder communication, easier maintenance, and better adaptability to changes. Overall, Requirement Analysis is not just the first step ‚Äî it‚Äôs the **most strategic step** in building software that delivers real value.

## üîß Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that help ensure the software being developed aligns with stakeholder expectations and system constraints. The five key activities include:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This involves collecting raw requirements from stakeholders, including users, clients, domain experts, and project sponsors. It typically includes interviews, questionnaires, surveys, and observation of existing systems or processes.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Elicitation is the process of actively engaging stakeholders to uncover their true needs, even if they are not explicitly stated. Techniques include brainstorming sessions, use case discussions, prototyping, and Joint Application Development (JAD) workshops.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Once requirements are gathered and clarified, they are documented in a structured and readable format such as a Software Requirement Specification (SRS), user stories, or use case descriptions. This documentation serves as a reference point throughout the project.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  This activity involves refining and structuring the documented requirements, resolving conflicts, and checking for completeness and feasibility. Modeling tools such as use case diagrams, flowcharts, or data flow diagrams are often used to visually represent the system behavior and relationships.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  The final step is to verify that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholder needs and are feasible within project constraints. This may involve stakeholder reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping to gain formal approval and avoid misunderstandings later in development.

These activities help transform vague ideas into actionable, testable, and clearly defined requirements that serve as the blueprint for successful software development.

## üß© Types of Requirements

In software engineering, requirements are generally classified into two main categories: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Understanding the distinction between these types helps ensure that both system behavior and performance expectations are clearly defined.

### ‚úÖ Functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Functional requirements describe what the system should do. They define specific behavior, features, and functions the software must perform to fulfill user needs and business goals.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- The system shall allow users to create an account and log in securely.
- The system shall allow users to search for available bookings by date, time, or service type.
- The system shall allow administrators to manage booking slots (add, update, or remove).
- The system shall send confirmation emails to users after a successful booking.
- The system shall allow users to cancel or modify existing bookings.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Non-functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Non-functional requirements define how the system performs its functions. They are related to system quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, and reliability.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- The system shall be available 99.9% of the time (high availability).
- The system shall respond to user search queries within 2 seconds.
- The system shall encrypt all sensitive user data using AES-256 encryption.
- The system shall be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices (responsive design).
- The system shall support up to 10,000 concurrent users without degradation in performance.

Both functional and non-functional requirements are essential to build a robust and reliable system. While functional requirements focus on the **‚Äúwhat,‚Äù** non-functional requirements focus on the **‚Äúhow.‚Äù**
