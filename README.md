# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** project repository. This repository is part of the *FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint* project, which focuses on developing a detailed and structured approach to requirement analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## üìå Purpose

This project simulates a real-world scenario where you will define the requirements for a **Booking Management System**. It emphasizes clarity, precision, and structure in documenting both functional and non-functional requirements to lay the groundwork for a successful development process.

## üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs Included

- Introduction to requirement analysis concepts
- Requirement gathering documentation
- Functional vs. non-functional requirements
- Use case identification and diagramming
- Visual modeling using Draw.io
- Acceptance criteria for features

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand and apply SDLC principles
- Translate business needs into clear, testable requirements
- Use diagrams to visualize system actors and interactions
- Define acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Apply best practices in documentation and modeling

## üß∞ Tools Used

- GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Markdown for documentation
- Draw.io (or equivalent) for diagramming use cases
